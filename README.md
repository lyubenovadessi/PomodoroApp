# 🍅 Pomodoro Timer
A simple and colorful Pomodoro Timer app built using Python and Tkinter.
It helps you manage your productivity with alternating work and break sessions, following the Pomodoro Technique.

# 🧠 What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into focused intervals (usually 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.
After four cycles, you take a longer break.
It’s an easy and effective way to stay productive while avoiding burnout.
